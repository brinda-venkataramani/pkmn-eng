{"name":"Pokemon Engine","tagline":"Pokemon engine scripted in Python 2.7. My attempt at making a fan-made Pokemon game.","body":"## About\r\nPokemon engine scripted in Python 2.7. This is my official attempt at making a Pokemon game sans ROM hacking. The library is open source so as to enable other individuals who are interested in scripting their original idea to do so. Currently, this engine is only capable of scripting games. This means that any games produced will NOT have any graphics whatsoever. I hope to remedy this, but for the time being, my goal is to code a properly working engine, with few to no bugs. After that, I'll deal with implementing graphics, etc.\r\n## Features\r\n+ Working on Poke/Ability/Move-Dexes to allow for easy scripting. (est. 2016-03-21)\r\n\r\n## Change Log\r\n+ Created Pokemon class to initialize Pokemon.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\nIs this a Pokemon game making tool?\r\n> To some extent yes. It is not yet capable of making a full-fledged executable Pokemon game, but does include several snippets of reusable code to script a game in (i.e. bare-bones story sans graphics).\r\n\r\nIs this a GUI tool?\r\n> No. You need to know how to code in Python to use this resource. That said, Python is relatively straightforward and there are several excellent tutorials which can be found via a quick Google search.\r\n\r\nI'd like to contribute. How can I do so?\r\n> Once this project really gets underway, around the end of March, I'll host a change-log/to-do list on the page. If you wish to contribute, just check the change-log/to-do list to see what you can help with. If you're interested in implementing mapping/graphics, please contact me directly.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
