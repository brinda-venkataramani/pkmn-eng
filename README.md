# Pokemon Engine
Pokemon engine scripted in Python 2.7. This is my official attempt at making a Pokemon game sans ROM hacking. The library is open source so as to enable other individuals who are interested in scripting their original idea to do so. Currently, this engine is only capable of scripting games. This means that any games produced will NOT have any graphics whatsoever. I hope to remedy this, but for the time being, my goal is to code a properly working engine, with few to no bugs. After that, I'll deal with implementing graphics, etc.
## Features
+ Working on Poke/Ability/Move-Dexes to allow for easy scripting. (est. 2016-03-21)
